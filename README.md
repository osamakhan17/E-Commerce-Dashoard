# E-Commerce-Dashoard

I completed a project using Microsoft Excel and the E-Commerce Dashboard dataset. The project involved analyzing sales data based on different product categories and creating a sales dashboard with user controls. <br>

I prepared tables to showcase sales and profit month-wise, as well as region-wise. I implemented a user control combo box for product category selection, allowing users to view the trend month-wise and product-wise accordingly. Using column charts, I visualized the data and linked the tables with the combo box. <br>

The deliverable of the project was a sales dashboard that provided insights into sales performance based on product categories. The interactive nature of the dashboard allowed users to explore the data and understand trends in sales. The project demonstrated my proficiency in Excel, data analysis, and creating visually appealing dashboards for data-driven decision-making. <br>

Overall, this project highlights my skills in data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and creating user-friendly dashboards using Microsoft Excel <br>
